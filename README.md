Project Title: Classification of Online Sexism with Different Transformer Models

Sexism is a growing problem online that can cause harm and perpetuate injustices. While automated tools detect sexist content, they lack fine-grained classifications and explanations, reducing interpretability and trust. To empower users and moderators, we must identify and explain what constitutes sexist content. For this project, we will aim to develop more accurate and explainable English-language models for sexism detection, featuring 4 fine-grained classification models for Gab and Reddit's sexist content through 3 unique classification subtasks.
